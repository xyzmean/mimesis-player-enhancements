You want more from MIMESIS multiplayer — more players, more voice lines, voices that stick around after saving, joining friends mid-round, and stats that actually track who did what. This mod bundles those tweaks into **one plugin** with a single config file, instead of juggling several separate mods.

Tested with **MIMESIS 0.3.0** and **MelonLoader 0.7.3**.

Please support the original authors as well :)

## Install

1. Install the latest [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) on your MIMESIS Steam copy.
2. Download `MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements/releases).
3. Copy the file into your game folder:  
   `<Mimesis Steam folder>/Mods/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll`
4. Start the game once.

If you used the old separate mods (MorePlayers, More Voices, MimesisPersistence, JoinAnytime, **MoreMimics**), remove them so they do not fight with this one. Spawn scaling in this mod replaces MoreMimics.

## Config

After the first launch, the mod creates a config file here:

```
<Mimesis Steam folder>/UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg
```

You can edit it anytime. The game reloads the file while running, but **most changes only fully apply after a restart**. Some settings may not update correctly until you quit and start again.

**Float values:** Most multipliers, timers, and similar settings are floats — not just whole numbers. Values like `0.1`, `1.5`, or `2.5` are valid (`0.1` = 10% of vanilla where `1` = vanilla). On load the mod normalizes saved floats to one or two decimal places (e.g. `1` → `1.0`, `1.22222` → `1.22`).

Settings are grouped into TOML sections in the config file:

- **`[MimesisPlayerEnhancement]`** — global options not tied to a single feature
- **`[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_FeatureName]`** — one section per feature (e.g. `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MorePlayers]`)

Each feature section has its own master toggle plus feature-specific options.

**Player-count scaling:** Several features offer an **Auto Scale … By Player Count** toggle. When enabled and the session has more than 4 players, the effective value is multiplied by player count ÷ 4 (e.g. 8 players → ×2 on top of your base multiplier).

### Global — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement]`

Mod-wide settings that are not owned by a single feature.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `ModToastDurationSeconds` | float | `5.0` | How long `[PlayerEnhancements]` toasts stay visible before fading. Vanilla join/leave toasts are unchanged (~2 seconds). Each player controls this locally. Minimum is `1`. |

| `EnableMorePlayers` | bool | `true` | Turn the higher player cap on or off. When off, the game stays at 4 players. |
| `MaxPlayers` | int | `32` | Max players in a session, host included. `1` = solo, `2` = host + one friend, and so on. Minimum is `1`. |

### Persistence — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_Persistence]`

Host-only. Keep mimic voice recordings across save and load.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|

### Statistics — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_Statistics]`

Host-only. Track session stats and a per-save-slot leaderboard (deaths, kills, voice events, play time, and more).

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableStatistics` | bool | `true` | Track player stats per save slot. |
| `SessionReconnectGraceMinutes` | int | `5` | If someone disconnects and rejoins within this many minutes, their stats session continues instead of starting fresh. Minimum is `1`. |

### Player Announcements — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_PlayerAnnouncements]`

Host-only. In-game toasts for dungeon run settings at shift start, boss spawn alerts, and your per-map stats when you die.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `ShowPlayerAnnouncements` | bool | `true` | Show dungeon settings, boss spawn, and death-stat toasts. Does not replace the game's own messages. |

### Join Anytime — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_JoinAnytime]`

**Every player in the lobby needs the mod** for this feature. Lets players join a session after a round has already started.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableJoinAnytime` | bool | `true` | Let players join after a round has already started. |

### Spawn Scaling — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_SpawnScaling]`

Host-only. Scale dungeon monster and trap spawn budgets by type. Map-placed mimics, bosses, jakos, specials, and traps use unused markers first, then respawn at the same marker when all markers are in use.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableSpawnScaling` | bool | `true` | Master toggle for all spawn scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleMimicSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for mimic spawns (stacks with `MimicSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `MimicSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Mimic spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleBossSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for boss spawns (stacks with `BossSpawnMultiplier`). |

| `AutoScaleSpecialSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for special spawns (stacks with `SpecialSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `SpecialSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Special monster spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTrapSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for trap spawns (stacks with `TrapSpawnMultiplier`). |

| `FixedSpawnRespawnDelayMaxSeconds` | float | `30.0` | Maximum random delay (seconds) before a map-placed monster or trap respawns at the same marker when all markers are in use. Must be ≥ `FixedSpawnRespawnDelayMinSeconds`. |
| `FixedSpawnRespawnMinPlayerDistanceMeters` | float | `10.0` | After the respawn delay, wait until no players are within this distance (meters) before spawning at the marker. Set to `0` to respawn immediately. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleOtherSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for other spawns (stacks with `OtherSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `OtherSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Spawn multiplier for other entities (not mimic/boss/jako/special/trap). Minimum is `0`. |

### Loot Multiplicator — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_LootMultiplicator]`

Host-only. Each setting is a **source × item type** pair. The multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double) stacks with the matching **Auto Scale … By Player Count** toggle when player-count scaling is enabled.

**Loot sources** — where the item comes from:

| Prefix | Source | What it affects |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Map** | Map spawn points | Loot placed when a dungeon room loads. **All** map loot slots: scales `StackCount` and `MaxRespawnCount`. **Fixed** loot (a specific item tied to a marker): may also activate unused loot markers of the same item and respawn at the same marker when picked up (uses `FixedSpawnRespawnDelay*` from Spawn Scaling). **Random** loot pools (weighted mix of items): only stack/respawn scaling; extra markers are not added. Random pools use the **dominant** item type in the pool to pick which multiplier applies. |
| **Drop** | Enemy death drops | Items from enemy death tables when killed. Duplicates extra item IDs in the drop list (more separate drops). Also tries to scale stack count when the item spawns (`ActorDying`); stack scaling is reliable for **consumables**, less so for equipment/miscellany. |
| **Trigger** | Map events / trigger volumes | Items spawned by map events (`EventAction` only). Tries to scale stack count when the item appears; stack scaling is reliable for **consumables**, less so for equipment/miscellany. |

**Item types** — from the game's item data (`Consumable`, `Equipment`, `Miscellany`):

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Consumable** | Ammo, healing, and other used-up items |
| **Equipment** | Tools, weapons, and gear you equip |
| **Miscellany** | Other pickups — keys, misc objects, etc. Unknown items fall back to Miscellany. |

Each source has three multiplier + auto-scale pairs (Consumable, Equipment, Miscellany):

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableLootMultiplicator` | bool | `true` | Master toggle for all loot scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleMapConsumableLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for map consumables (see tables above). |
| `MapConsumableLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for map consumables. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleMapEquipmentLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for map equipment. |
| `MapEquipmentLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for map equipment. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleMapMiscellanyLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for map miscellany. |
| `MapMiscellanyLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for map miscellany. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleDropConsumableLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for consumables from enemy deaths. |
| `DropConsumableLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for consumable death drops. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleDropEquipmentLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for equipment from enemy deaths. |
| `DropEquipmentLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for equipment death drops. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleDropMiscellanyLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for miscellany from enemy deaths. |
| `DropMiscellanyLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for miscellany death drops. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTriggerConsumableLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for consumables from map events/triggers. |
| `TriggerConsumableLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for event/trigger consumables. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTriggerEquipmentLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for equipment from map events/triggers. |
| `TriggerEquipmentLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for event/trigger equipment. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTriggerMiscellanyLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for miscellany from map events/triggers. |
| `TriggerMiscellanyLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Base multiplier for event/trigger miscellany. Minimum is `0`. |

Does **not** scale: items you release from inventory, shop purchases, admin/cheat spawns, or other spawn reasons (e.g. `Release`, `Buying`, `Admin`, `Skill`). Map loot is scaled once at room load — not again when it spawns in the world.

### Money Multiplier — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MoneyMultiplier]`

Host-only. Scales six separate money values. Each has an **Auto Scale … By Player Count** toggle and a multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum multiplier is `0`.

| Money type | What it affects |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Startup** | Starting currency on a new game or maintenance session reset |
| **Round goal** | Target currency (quota) required to finish a stage |
| **Scrap / sell value** | Currency from scrapping items and item value counted in the tram toward the quota |
| **Shop buy price** | Maintenance shop and vending-machine kiosk purchase cost (shown in UI and charged on buy) |
| **Shop items** | Number of unique items offered in the maintenance shop |
| **Reinforce price** | Maintenance item reinforcement cost |

Does **not** change saved player balances on load or mid-round currency pickups. Complements **Loot Multiplicator** (item quantity) — this mod scales currency amounts and prices, not how many items spawn.

**Shop discounts:** When `ShopDiscountChancePercent` is above `0`, each shop item independently rolls for a discount. Successful rolls pick a random percentage between `ShopDiscountMinPercent` and `ShopDiscountMaxPercent`, update the item's sale price, and sync vending-machine displays. At `0` chance, vanilla shop discount tables are used unchanged.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMoneyMultiplier` | bool | `true` | Master toggle for all money scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleStartupMoneyByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for startup money. |
| `StartupMoneyMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Startup money multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleRoundGoalMoneyByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for stage target currency. |
| `RoundGoalMoneyMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Round goal (quota) multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleScrapSellValueByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for scrap/sell values. |
| `ScrapSellValueMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scrap/sell value multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleShopBuyPriceByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for shop buy prices. |
| `ShopBuyPriceMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Maintenance shop and vending-machine kiosk buy price multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `0.1` = 10% of vanilla). Applied when shop items are initialized each maintenance round. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleShopItemsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for shop item count. |
| `ShopItemsMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Number of unique maintenance shop items (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Extra items are rolled from vending-machine shop groups on the map. Minimum is `0`. |
| `ShopDiscountMinPercent` | int | `0` | Minimum discount percentage when a shop discount is rolled (`0`–`100`). Only used when `ShopDiscountChancePercent` is above `0`. |
| `ShopDiscountMaxPercent` | int | `100` | Maximum discount percentage when a shop discount is rolled (`0`–`100`). Must be ≥ `ShopDiscountMinPercent`. |
| `ShopDiscountChancePercent` | int | `0` | Chance per shop item to receive a discount in the min–max range (`0` = vanilla shop discounts, `100` = every item discounted). |
| `AutoScaleReinforcePriceByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for reinforce costs. |
| `ReinforcePriceMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Reinforce price multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |

### Dungeon Time — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_DungeonTime]`

Host-only. When a dungeon shift starts (all members entered), extends the real shift deadline by `ExtraShiftSecondsPerPlayerAboveBaseline` for each player above `DungeonTimeBaselinePlayerCount`. Applied once per dungeon room; late Join Anytime arrivals do not add more time.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableDungeonTime` | bool | `true` | Master toggle for shift extension. |
| `DungeonTimeBaselinePlayerCount` | int | `4` | No extra shift time at or below this player count. Minimum is `1`. |
| `ExtraShiftSecondsPerPlayerAboveBaseline` | float | `10.0` | Real seconds added to the shift deadline per player above the baseline. Minimum is `0`. |

### Dungeon Randomizer — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_DungeonRandomizer]`

Host-only. Randomizes dungeon selection at four independent layers when enabled. Off by default — set `EnableDungeonRandomizer = true` to turn it on. Each layer has its own toggle so you can randomize only what you want.

**Layers:**

| Layer | What it affects |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Dungeon pick** | Which dungeon master ID appears on the tram roll |
| **Layout flow** | DunGen procedural layout variant within a dungeon |
| **Map variant** | Which map ID is chosen from the dungeon's `MapIDs` |
| **Seed** | Procedural `RandomDungeonSeed` used for room generation |

**Pool modes** (`DungeonPickPoolMode`):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `WidenVanilla` | Keep vanilla cycle weights; optionally allow repeats sooner via `IgnoreDungeonExcludeList` |
| `AllActiveUniform` | Pick uniformly from all active dungeons (ignores the cycle table) |

`DungeonAllowlist` and `DungeonBlocklist` filter the pool regardless of mode. Allowlist wins when non-empty: only listed IDs are eligible.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableDungeonRandomizer` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all dungeon randomization below. |
| `RandomizeDungeonPick` | bool | `true` | Override tram dungeon master ID selection. |
| `DungeonPickPoolMode` | string | `WidenVanilla` | `WidenVanilla` or `AllActiveUniform` (see table above). |
| `DungeonAllowlist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated dungeon master IDs. When non-empty, only these IDs are eligible. |
| `DungeonBlocklist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated dungeon master IDs to exclude. |
| `IgnoreDungeonExcludeList` | bool | `true` | With `WidenVanilla`, do not exclude recently played dungeons from the tram roll. |
| `RandomizeLayoutFlow` | bool | `true` | Pick DunGen layout flows uniformly instead of weighted vanilla rolls. |
| `RandomizeMapVariant` | bool | `true` | Pick map variants uniformly from each dungeon's `MapIDs`. |
| `RandomizeDungeonSeed` | bool | `true` | Replace the procedural dungeon seed when a dungeon is chosen. |

### Spectator Transition — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_SpectatorTransition]`

Shortens how long players stay downed before spectator mode and how long the local dead-camera transition runs. Multipliers use the same scale as spawn/loot settings: `1` = vanilla, `0.5` = half, `0` = instant.

`DyingWaitTimeMultiplier` is **host only** (server-authoritative down time). It also shortens the window teammates have to revive you. `DeadCameraDurationMultiplier` applies on each machine that has the mod loaded — for a consistent feel, use the same values on host and clients.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableSpectatorTransition` | bool | `true` | Master toggle for shorter death-to-spectator timing. |
| `DyingWaitTimeMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales server down/dying time before spectator (`0` = instant). Host only. Also shortens the teammate revive window. Minimum is `0`. |
| `DeadCameraDurationMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales local dead-camera blend and duration before spectator (`0` = instant). Minimum is `0`. |

### Web Dashboard — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_WebDashboard]`

Host-only. Serves a local HTTP dashboard from the game process while a session is active. Open `http://<ListenAddress>:<ListenPort>/` in a browser (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`). Off by default — set `EnableWebDashboard = true` to turn it on.

**What you get:**

| View | Who can see it | What it shows |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Players** | Anyone who can reach the URL | Connected players with avatars, host/local badges, network grade, and ban status |
| **Leaderboard** | Host only | Per-save-slot stats leaderboard (requires **Statistics** enabled) |
| **Player stats** | Host only | Per-player statistics for the active save slot (requires **Statistics** enabled) |
| **Moderation** | Host only | Kick, ban, and unban actions queued on the game thread |

**Security:** Default bind is `127.0.0.1` (loopback) so only your machine can connect. Binding to another address (e.g. `0.0.0.0` or your LAN IP) exposes the dashboard to anyone on that network — there is no login. Only use a non-loopback address on a network you trust.

Listen address and port changes take effect when the config reloads (the HTTP server restarts). Port must be between `1` and `65535`.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableWebDashboard` | bool | `false` | Turn the local web dashboard on or off. |
| `WebDashboardListenAddress` | string | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address. Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only access. |
| `WebDashboardListenPort` | int | `8001` | TCP port for the web dashboard. Must be `1`–`65535`. |
