> [!NOTE]  
> Disclosure: this project is being build with help of AI!

> [!CAUTION]  
> **Alpha — under heavy development.** This plugin is not finished and things may not work as expected. Please report bugs and share feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements/issues).

> [!WARNING]  
> I am not responsible for any damage, data loss, bans, or other problems that come from using this mod. Mods change how the game runs, and things can break.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not trust a pre-built `.dll`, you can [build this mod yourself](#build-from-source) from the source code here on GitHub. That takes some basic dev setup, but you know exactly what you are running.

Mimesis Player Enhancement is a mod for Mimesis that consolidates and extends a lot of tweaks into one maintained package. Hosts can raise the player limits, expand mimic voice recording and persistence (across game sessions), allow players to join at any time, scale spawns/loot/money to match their needs, randomize dungeons, tune player and mimic behavior, and track session statistics — all from one config file. Clients do not need the mod; only the host does. It also enables the player to use up to 99 different save games within a new UI.

Additionally, there is also a webinterface listening on http://127.0.0.1:8001 per default after the game has been started. It allows you to manage bigger lobbies (kick, ban, respawn) as well as change settings per savegame or globally.

Tested with **MIMESIS 0.3.0** and **MelonLoader 0.7.3**.

Inspired by community mods like [MorePlayers from NeoMimicry](https://github.com/NeoMimicry/MorePlayers), [MoreVoices from Risikus](https://thunderstore.io/c/mimesis/p/Risikus/More_Voices/), [MimesisPersistence from JoanR](https://github.com/JoanRLopez/MimesisPersistence), and [MimesisJoinAnytime from Shlygly](https://github.com/Shlygly/MimesisJoinAnytime). Thanks for your ideas and initial work :)

## Install

1. Install the latest [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) on your MIMESIS Steam copy.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements/releases).
3. Copy the file(s) and Folder into your game folder:  
   `<Mimesis Steam folder>/Mods/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll`
   `<Mimesis Steam folder>/Mods/MimesisPlayerEnhancement/*`
4. Start the game once.

If you used the old separate mods (MorePlayers, More Voices, MimesisPersistence, JoinAnytime, MoreMimics), remove them so they do not fight with this one or disable the feature inside this modification.

## Config

After the first launch, the mod creates a config file here:

```
<Mimesis Steam folder>/UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg
```

You can edit it anytime. The game reloads the file while running, but **most changes only fully apply after a restart**. Some settings may not update correctly until you quit and start again.

Settings are grouped into TOML sections in the config file:

- **`[MimesisPlayerEnhancement]`** — global options not tied to a single feature
- **`[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_FeatureName]`** — one section per feature (e.g. `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MorePlayers]`)

Each feature section has its own master toggle plus feature-specific options.


### Global — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement]`

Mod-wide settings that are not owned by a single feature.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `ModToastDurationSeconds` | float | `5.0` | How long `[PlayerEnhancements]` toasts stay visible before fading. Vanilla join/leave toasts are unchanged (~2 seconds). Each player controls this locally. Minimum is `1`. |
| `EnableDebugLogging` | bool | `false` | Emit verbose diagnostic lines to the MelonLoader console. Useful for troubleshooting. |

### More Players — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MorePlayers]`

Host-only. Raise the vanilla 4-player session cap.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMorePlayers` | bool | `false` | Turn the higher player cap on or off. When off, the game stays at 4 players. |
| `MaxPlayers` | int | `32` | Max players in a session, host included. `1` = solo, `2` = host + one friend, and so on. Minimum is `1`. |

### More Voices — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MoreVoices]`

Host-only. Raise per-player mimic voice recording limits.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMoreVoices` | bool | `true` | Turn higher voice recording limits on or off. |
| `MaxIndoorVoiceEvents` | int | `3000` | How many mimic voice lines each player can store in indoor dungeon runs. Minimum is `1`. |
| `MaxDeathMatchVoiceEvents` | int | `3000` | How many mimic voice lines each player can store in deathmatch. Minimum is `1`. |
| `MaxOutdoorVoiceEvents` | int | `3000` | How many mimic voice lines each player can store outdoors. Minimum is `1`. |

### Persistence — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_Persistence]`

Host-only. Keep mimic voice recordings across save and load.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnablePersistence` | bool | `true` | Save mimic voices when you save the game and bring them back when you load. |

### Statistics — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_Statistics]`

Host-only. Track session stats and a per-save-slot leaderboard (deaths, kills, voice events, play time, and more).

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableStatistics` | bool | `true` | Track player stats per save slot. |
| `SessionReconnectGraceMinutes` | int | `5` | If someone disconnects and rejoins within this many minutes, their stats session continues instead of starting fresh. Minimum is `1`. |
| `ShowStatisticsToasts` | bool | `true` | Show small join/leave/cycle messages in the bottom-left corner when statistics are enabled. Does not replace the game's own connect messages. |

### Player Announcements — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_PlayerAnnouncements]`

Host-only. In-game toasts for dungeon run settings at shift start, boss spawn alerts, and your per-map stats when you die.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `ShowPlayerAnnouncements` | bool | `true` | Show dungeon settings, boss spawn, and death-stat toasts. Does not replace the game's own messages. |

### Join Anytime — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_JoinAnytime]`

Host-only. Lets players join a lobby after a session has already started. **Joiners do not need this mod** — only the host does.

Late joiners cannot be dropped straight into an active dungeon (the game has no stock path for that). Instead, the host server sends the player into a waiting room. They wait on the tram map until the party finishes the current dungeon; when everyone returns to the tram, the next lever pull starts the next run together.

**What it does:**

1. Allows login while a session is already running (`CanEnterSession`).
2. When a joiner appears in `MaintenanceRoom`, ensures a `VWaitingRoom` exists on the server (creates one with `InitWaitingRoom` if the original was wiped when the dungeon started).
3. Sends unicast `MakeRoomCompleteSig` (`roomType = Waiting`) and `MoveToWaitingRoomSig` so the stock client loads `InTramWaitingScene` and completes `EnterWaitingRoomReq`.
4. Blocks the tram start lever on the server (`VWaitingRoom.OnRequestStartGame`) while players are split — e.g. some still in the dungeon, or not everyone is in the waiting room yet (`CantStartGame`).

**Limitations:**

- Joiners **do not** land mid-dungeon; they sit out the current run in the tram.
- If the host is still in maintenance or already in the tram (pre-lever), joiners are routed to the same waiting room via the same packets.
- Public lobby visibility helpers still run on the host when this feature is enabled.
- Hosts can toggle public matchmaking and edit the lobby title from the ESC menu in the tram or during a dungeon run — not only in the maintenance room.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableJoinAnytime` | bool | `true` | Let players join after a session has already started. |

### Spawn Scaling — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_SpawnScaling]`

Host-only. Scale dungeon monster and trap spawn budgets by type. Periodic jakos and mimics use native threat/count budgets plus faster spawn windows. Map-placed bosses, specials, and traps activate unused alternate markers for extra concurrent slots, then schedule bonus encounters one-at-a-time after a kill (never duplicate spawns at load).

Upgrading from older configs: legacy `FixedSpawnRespawn*` keys are copied once automatically to the `MapPlacedEncounter*` keys below.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableSpawnScaling` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all spawn scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleMimicSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for mimic spawns (stacks with `MimicSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `MimicSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Total mimic spawn budget across the run, including periodic spawns (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleBossSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for boss spawns (stacks with `BossSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `BossSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Map-placed bosses: unused alternate markers plus bonus encounters after kill (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleJakoSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for jako spawns (stacks with `JakoSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `JakoSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Total normal-monster threat budget for ambient dungeon spawns (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleSpecialSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for special spawns (stacks with `SpecialSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `SpecialSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Special monster budget for periodic spawns and map-placed specials (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTrapSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for trap spawns (stacks with `TrapSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `TrapSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Map-placed traps: unused alternate markers plus bonus encounters after trigger/kill (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum is `0`. |
| `MapPlacedEncounterDelayMinSeconds` | float | `5.0` | Shortest wait (seconds) after a map-placed enemy/trap dies before the next bonus encounter can spawn at that marker. Minimum is `0`. |
| `MapPlacedEncounterDelayMaxSeconds` | float | `30.0` | Longest wait for that random delay. Actual delay is picked between min and max. Must be ≥ `MapPlacedEncounterDelayMinSeconds`. |
| `MapPlacedEncounterMinPlayerDistanceMeters` | float | `10.0` | After the delay, hold the spawn until no living players are within this radius (meters) of the marker. Set to `0` to spawn as soon as the delay elapses. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleOtherSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for other spawns (stacks with `OtherSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `OtherSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Spawn multiplier for other entities (not mimic/boss/jako/special/trap). Minimum is `0`. |

### Loot Multiplicator — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_LootMultiplicator]`

Host-only. Scale how much loot appears on the map and from enemy deaths, and optionally convert mimic fake drops to real pickup loot. Each multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double) stacks with its **Auto Scale … By Player Count** toggle when player-count scaling is enabled (`players / 4` above 4 players).

**Breaking change:** Per-item-type keys (`MapConsumableLootMultiplier`, `Trigger*`, etc.) were removed. Set `MapLootMultiplier` and `DropLootMultiplier` instead; old TOML keys are ignored.

**Loot sources:**

| Source | What it affects |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Map** | Loot placed when a dungeon room loads. **Fixed** loot (specific item at a marker): activates unused loot markers of the same item, scales consumable stack size and `MaxRespawnCount`, and may respawn at the same marker when picked up (uses `MapPlacedEncounterDelay*` and `MapPlacedEncounterMinPlayerDistanceMeters` from Spawn Scaling). **Random** loot pools: scales the dungeon misc budget so more markers fill with weighted random picks — not clones of the same item. |
| **Drop** | Items from enemy death tables when a monster is killed, plus inventory items dropped on death. Adds extra **weighted re-rolls** from the same drop table. Consumable stack count is also scaled when the item spawns (`ActorDying`). Mimics often drop **fake** decoy items from inventory — see `ConvertFakeActorDyingDropChancePercent`. Monster drop-table loot is already real. |

Map events / trigger spawns are **not** scaled (vanilla).

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableLootMultiplicator` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all loot scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleMapLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for map loot. |
| `MapLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Multiplier for all map-placed pickup loot. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleDropLootByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for enemy death drops. |
| `DropLootMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Multiplier for enemy death drops. Minimum is `0`. |
| `LootItemFilterMode` | string | `All` | `All`, `AllowlistOnly`, or `BlocklistOnly` — restrict which item master IDs are scaled. |
| `LootAllowlist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated item master IDs (e.g. `12345,67890`). Used when `LootItemFilterMode` is `AllowlistOnly`. See [docs/LOOT_ITEM_IDS.md](docs/LOOT_ITEM_IDS.md) for all IDs. |
| `LootBlocklist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated item master IDs to exclude. Used when `LootItemFilterMode` is `BlocklistOnly`. See [docs/LOOT_ITEM_IDS.md](docs/LOOT_ITEM_IDS.md) for all IDs. |
| `ConvertFakeActorDyingDropChancePercent` | int | `30` | Chance (0–100) that fake items dropped on enemy death (`ActorDying`, e.g. mimic inventory decoys) become real pickup loot. `0` = vanilla (vanish on grab), `100` = always real. |

Does **not** scale: map event/trigger spawns, items you release from inventory, shop purchases, admin/cheat spawns, creature/monster spawns, or other spawn reasons (e.g. `Release`, `Buying`, `Admin`, `Skill`). Map loot budgets and spawn data are scaled once at room load; drop extras use table re-rolls at spawn time.

### Money Multiplier — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MoneyMultiplier]`

Host-only. Scales five separate money values. Each has an **Auto Scale … By Player Count** toggle and a multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Minimum multiplier is `0`.

| Money type | What it affects |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Startup** | Starting currency on a new save slot or session reset (not when loading a save) |
| **Round goal** | Target currency (quota) required to finish a stage |
| **Scrap / sell value** | Currency from scrapping items and item value counted in the tram toward the quota |
| **Shop buy price** | Maintenance shop and vending-machine kiosk purchase cost (shown in UI and charged on buy) |
| **Reinforce price** | Maintenance item reinforcement cost |

Does **not** change saved player balances or shop prices on save load. Shop price multipliers and discount rolls apply on fresh `InitShopItems` rounds (e.g. returning from a dungeon). Complements **Loot Multiplicator** (item quantity) — this mod scales currency amounts and prices, not how many items spawn.

**Shop discounts:** When `ShopDiscountChancePercent` is above `0`, each shop item independently rolls for a discount. Successful rolls pick a random percentage between `ShopDiscountMinPercent` and `ShopDiscountMaxPercent`, update the item's sale price, and sync vending-machine displays. At `0` chance, vanilla shop discount tables are used unchanged.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMoneyMultiplier` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all money scaling below. |
| `AutoScaleStartupMoneyByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for startup money. |
| `StartupMoneyMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Startup money multiplier on new save or session reset. Minimum is `0`. Does not apply when loading a save. |
| `AutoScaleRoundGoalMoneyByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for stage target currency. |
| `RoundGoalMoneyMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Round goal (quota) multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleScrapSellValueByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for scrap/sell values. |
| `ScrapSellValueMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scrap/sell value multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleShopBuyPriceByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for shop buy prices. |
| `ShopBuyPriceMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Maintenance shop and vending-machine kiosk buy price multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `0.1` = 10% of vanilla). Applied when shop items are initialized each maintenance round. Minimum is `0`. |
| `ShopDiscountMinPercent` | int | `0` | Minimum discount percentage when a shop discount is rolled (`0`–`100`). Only used when `ShopDiscountChancePercent` is above `0`. |
| `ShopDiscountMaxPercent` | int | `100` | Maximum discount percentage when a shop discount is rolled (`0`–`100`). Must be ≥ `ShopDiscountMinPercent`. |
| `ShopDiscountChancePercent` | int | `0` | Chance per shop item to receive a discount in the min–max range (`0` = vanilla shop discounts, `100` = every item discounted). |
| `AutoScaleReinforcePriceByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | Player-count scaling for reinforce costs. |
| `ReinforcePriceMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Reinforce price multiplier. Minimum is `0`. |

### Dungeon Time — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_DungeonTime]`

Host-only. When a dungeon shift starts (all members entered), extends the real shift deadline by `ExtraShiftSecondsPerPlayerAboveBaseline` for each player above `DungeonTimeBaselinePlayerCount`. Applied once per dungeon room; late Join Anytime arrivals do not add more time.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableDungeonTime` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for shift extension. |
| `DungeonTimeBaselinePlayerCount` | int | `4` | No extra shift time at or below this player count. Minimum is `1`. |
| `ExtraShiftSecondsPerPlayerAboveBaseline` | float | `10.0` | Real seconds added to the shift deadline per player above the baseline. Minimum is `0`. |

### Mimic Tuning — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_MimicTuning]`

Host-only. When you are dead and press **E** to speak through a nearby mimic, vanilla uses a fixed speak window (`C_PossessionDuration`) and a fixed cooldown before the next possession (`C_PossessionCooltime`). This feature can randomize the speak window per possession and/or scale the cooldown. Off by default — set `EnableMimicTuning = true` to turn it on.

**Speak duration:** When `RandomizeMimicPossessionDuration` is enabled, each possession rolls a random duration between `MimicPossessionMinTimeMultiplier` × vanilla and `MimicPossessionMaxTimeMultiplier` × vanilla. At `1.0` / `1.0` the roll equals vanilla length.

**Cooldown:** `MimicPossessionCooltimeMultiplier` scales the wait after possession ends (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Independent of the random duration toggle.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMimicTuning` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for mimic possession timing tweaks. |
| `RandomizeMimicPossessionDuration` | bool | `false` | Roll a random speak duration per E-possession between the min and max multipliers below. |
| `MimicPossessionMinTimeMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Minimum rolled speak duration as a multiple of vanilla (`1` = vanilla). Valid range is `0.1`–`10.0`. |
| `MimicPossessionMaxTimeMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Maximum rolled speak duration as a multiple of vanilla (`1` = vanilla). Valid range is `0.1`–`10.0`. |
| `MimicPossessionCooltimeMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Post-possession cooldown multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Valid range is `0.1`–`10.0`. |

### Player Tuning — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_PlayerTuning]`

Host-only. Scales player movement and stamina on the server. Joining clients do not need the mod — stats sync from the host automatically. Multipliers use `1.0` for vanilla; valid range is `0.1`–`5.0`. Changes apply at runtime when config is saved (host reloads player stats).

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnablePlayerTuning` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all player tuning below. |
| `MoveSpeedMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales walk and run base speed. |
| `MaxStaminaMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales maximum stamina. |
| `StaminaDrainMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales sprint stamina cost per tick (`0.5` = half drain). |
| `StaminaRegenMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales stamina recovered per regen tick. |
| `StaminaRegenDelayMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales wait before regen starts after sprinting (`0.5` = regen starts sooner). |
| `MaxCarryWeightMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Scales carry capacity before encumbrance slows movement. |

### Dungeon Randomizer — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_DungeonRandomizer]`

Host-only. Randomizes dungeon selection at four independent layers when enabled. Off by default — set `EnableDungeonRandomizer = true` to turn it on. Each layer has its own toggle so you can randomize only what you want.

**Layers:**

| Layer | What it affects |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Dungeon pick** | Which dungeon master ID appears on the tram roll |
| **Layout flow** | DunGen procedural layout variant within a dungeon |
| **Map variant** | Which map ID is chosen from the dungeon's `MapIDs` |
| **Seed** | Procedural `RandomDungeonSeed` used for room generation |

**Pool modes** (`DungeonPickPoolMode`):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `WidenVanilla` | Keep vanilla cycle weights; optionally allow repeats sooner via `IgnoreDungeonExcludeList` |
| `AllActiveUniform` | Pick uniformly from all active dungeons (ignores the cycle table) |

`DungeonAllowlist` and `DungeonBlocklist` filter the pool regardless of mode. Allowlist wins when non-empty: only listed IDs are eligible.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableDungeonRandomizer` | bool | `false` | Master toggle for all dungeon randomization below. |
| `RandomizeDungeonPick` | bool | `true` | Override tram dungeon master ID selection. |
| `DungeonPickPoolMode` | string | `WidenVanilla` | `WidenVanilla` or `AllActiveUniform` (see table above). |
| `DungeonAllowlist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated dungeon master IDs. When non-empty, only these IDs are eligible. |
| `DungeonBlocklist` | string | `""` | Comma-separated dungeon master IDs to exclude. |
| `IgnoreDungeonExcludeList` | bool | `true` | With `WidenVanilla`, do not exclude recently played dungeons from the tram roll. |
| `RandomizeLayoutFlow` | bool | `true` | Pick DunGen layout flows uniformly instead of weighted vanilla rolls. |
| `RandomizeMapVariant` | bool | `true` | Pick map variants uniformly from each dungeon's `MapIDs`. |
| `RandomizeDungeonSeed` | bool | `true` | Replace the procedural dungeon seed when a dungeon is chosen. |

### Web Dashboard — `[MimesisPlayerEnhancement_WebDashboard]`

Host-only. Serves a local HTTP dashboard from the game process. Open `http://<ListenAddress>:<ListenPort>/` in a browser (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`). On by default — set `EnableWebDashboard = false` to turn it off. The dashboard is available whenever the game is running with the web dashboard enabled (not only during an active session).

**What you get:**

| View | Who can see it | What it shows |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Global Settings** | Host (or idle before session) | Edit `UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg` defaults from the header menu |
| **Settings** | Host in an active save | Per-save-slot overrides (`MMGameData{N}.mpe-overrides.sav`); keys matching global are omitted automatically |
| **Players** | Anyone who can reach the URL | Connected players with avatars, host/local badges, network grade, and ban status |
| **Leaderboard** | Host only | Per-save-slot stats leaderboard (requires **Statistics** enabled) |
| **Player stats** | Host only | Per-player statistics for the active save slot (requires **Statistics** enabled) |
| **Moderation** | Host only | Kick, ban, and unban actions queued on the game thread |

**Security:** Default bind is `127.0.0.1` (loopback) so only your machine can connect. Binding to another address (e.g. `0.0.0.0` or your LAN IP) exposes the dashboard to anyone on that network — there is no login. Only use a non-loopback address on a network you trust.

Listen address and port changes take effect when the config reloads (the HTTP server restarts). Port must be between `1` and `65535`.

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableWebDashboard` | bool | `true` | Turn the local web dashboard on or off. |
| `WebDashboardListenAddress` | string | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address. Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only access. |
| `WebDashboardListenPort` | int | `8001` | TCP port for the web dashboard. Must be `1`–`65535`. |

## Build from source

You need [.NET SDK 8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). You do **not** need MIMESIS installed to compile.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/bootstrap-deps.sh   # first time only — downloads build dependencies
./scripts/build.sh            # → dist/debug/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll
./scripts/build.sh Release    # → dist/prod/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll
```

To copy the built DLL straight into your game for testing:

```bash
COPY_TO_MODS=true MIMESIS_PATH="/path/to/MIMESIS" ./scripts/build.sh
```
