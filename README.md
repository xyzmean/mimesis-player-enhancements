You want more from MIMESIS multiplayer — more players, more voice lines, voices that stick around after saving, joining friends mid-round, and stats that actually track who did what. This mod bundles those tweaks into **one plugin** with a single config file, instead of juggling several separate mods.

Tested with **MIMESIS 0.3.0** and **MelonLoader 0.7.3**.

## Features

| Feature | What it does | Everyone needs the mod? |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **More Players** | Raise the 4-player cap (default: 999) | No — host only |
| **More Voices** | Record more mimic voice lines (default: 3000) | No — host only |
| **Persistence** | Keep mimic voices after save/load | No — host only |
| **Join Anytime** | Join a session that already started | **Yes — every player** |
| **Statistics** | Session stats and leaderboard per save slot | No — host only |
| **Spawn Scaling** | Scale mimic/monster spawn budgets by type and player count | No — host only |

Based on community mods by [MorePlayers from NeoMimicry](https://github.com/NeoMimicry/MorePlayers), [MoreVoices from Risikus](https://thunderstore.io/c/mimesis/p/Risikus/More_Voices/), [MimesisPersistence from JoanR](https://github.com/JoanRLopez/MimesisPersistence), and [MimesisJoinAnytime from Shlygly](https://github.com/Shlygly/MimesisJoinAnytime). Please support the original authors instead of me :)

## Install

1. Install the latest [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) on your MIMESIS Steam copy.
2. Download `MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements/releases).
3. Copy the file into your game folder:  
   `<Mimesis Steam folder>/Mods/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll`
4. Start the game once.

If you used the old separate mods (MorePlayers, More Voices, MimesisPersistence, JoinAnytime, **MoreMimics**), remove them so they do not fight with this one. Spawn scaling in this mod replaces MoreMimics.

## Config

After the first launch, the mod creates a config file here:

```
<Mimesis Steam folder>/UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg
```

You can edit it anytime. The game reloads the file while running, but **most changes only fully apply after a restart**. Some settings may not update correctly until you quit and start again.

### Options

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| `EnableMorePlayers` | bool | `true` | Turn the higher player cap on or off. When off, the game stays at 4 players. |
| `MaxPlayers` | int | `999` | Max players in a session, host included. `1` = solo, `2` = host + one friend, and so on. Minimum is `1`. |
| `EnableMoreVoices` | bool | `true` | Turn higher voice recording limits on or off. |
| `MaxVoiceEvents` | int | `3000` | How many mimic voice lines each player can store. The normal game limit is much lower. Minimum is `1`. |
| `EnablePersistence` | bool | `true` | Save mimic voices when you save the game and bring them back when you load. |
| `EnableStatistics` | bool | `true` | Track player stats (deaths, kills, voice events, play time, etc.) per save slot. Host only. |
| `SessionReconnectGraceMinutes` | int | `5` | If someone disconnects and rejoins within this many minutes, their stats session continues instead of starting fresh. Minimum is `1`. |
| `ShowStatisticsToasts` | bool | `true` | Show small join/leave/cycle messages in the bottom-left corner when statistics are enabled. |
| `EnableJoinAnytime` | bool | `true` | Let players join after a round has already started. Every player in the lobby needs the mod for this. |
| `EnableSpawnScaling` | bool | `true` | Scale dungeon monster spawn budgets by type. Host only. |
| `AutoScaleMimicSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply mimic spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `MimicSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `MimicSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Mimic spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Map-placed mimics also use unused markers first, then respawn at the same marker. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleBossSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply boss spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `BossSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `BossSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Boss spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Map-placed bosses also use unused markers first, then respawn at the same marker. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleJakoSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply jako spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `JakoSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `JakoSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Jako (normal monster) spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Map-placed jakos also use unused markers first, then respawn at the same marker. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleSpecialSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply special spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `SpecialSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `SpecialSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Special monster spawn budget multiplier (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Map-placed specials also use unused markers first, then respawn at the same marker. Minimum is `0`. |
| `AutoScaleTrapSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply trap spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `TrapSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `TrapSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Trap/hazard spawn multiplier for map-placed spawns (`1` = vanilla, `2` = double). Uses unused map markers first, then respawns at the same marker when gone. Minimum is `0`. |
| `FixedSpawnRespawnDelayMinSeconds` | float | `5.0` | Minimum random delay (seconds) before a map-placed monster or trap respawns at the same marker when all markers are in use. |
| `FixedSpawnRespawnDelayMaxSeconds` | float | `30.0` | Maximum random delay (seconds) before a map-placed monster or trap respawns at the same marker when all markers are in use. |
| `AutoScaleOtherSpawnsByPlayerCount` | bool | `true` | When on, multiply other spawns by player count ÷ 4 above 4 players (stacks with `OtherSpawnMultiplier`). |
| `OtherSpawnMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Spawn multiplier for other entities (not mimic/boss/jako/special/trap). Minimum is `0`. |
| `EnableDebugLogging` | bool | `false` | Write extra detail to the MelonLoader console. Useful for troubleshooting; leave off for normal play. |

## Build from source

You need [.NET SDK 8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). You do **not** need MIMESIS installed to compile.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/bootstrap-deps.sh   # first time only — downloads build dependencies
./scripts/build.sh            # → dist/debug/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll
./scripts/build.sh Release    # → dist/prod/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll
```

To copy the built DLL straight into your game for testing:

```bash
COPY_TO_MODS=true MIMESIS_PATH="/path/to/MIMESIS" ./scripts/build.sh
```
