# Mimesis Player Enhancement

> **Warning — use at your own risk.** Mods change how the game runs; things can break. Only download MelonLoader from [melonwiki.xyz](https://melonwiki.xyz/). If you do not trust a pre-built DLL, [build from source on GitHub](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements).

One plugin for MIMESIS multiplayer: more players, more mimic voices, voice persistence, join-anytime, statistics, spawn/loot/money scaling, dungeon tweaks, a web dashboard, and more — with a single config file instead of juggling separate mods.

Tested with **MIMESIS 0.3.0** and **MelonLoader 0.7.3**.

## Install

### Mod manager (recommended)

Install through **r2modman**, **Gale**, or another Thunderstore client. The MelonLoader dependency is pulled in automatically.

### Manual

1. Install [MelonLoader 0.7.3+](https://melonwiki.xyz/) on your MIMESIS Steam copy.
2. Extract this package and copy `MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll` and the `MimesisPlayerEnhancement/` folder into `<MIMESIS>/Mods/`.
3. Start the game once.

Remove older separate mods (MorePlayers, More Voices, MimesisPersistence, JoinAnytime, **MoreMimics**) if you still have them — this mod replaces them.

## Web dashboard

While you host a session, the mod can serve a **browser dashboard** — a companion web UI so you do not have to dig through config files for every tweak. Set `EnableWebDashboard = true` in config, start a session, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8001/` (default address and port).

The dashboard is not only for admin actions. From the same interface you can:

- **Change settings on the fly** — edit mod config values in real time; changes are saved to the host config file and apply as the game picks them up (some settings, such as player caps, take effect immediately).
- **View statistics** — session leaderboard and per-player stats when Statistics is enabled.
- **Use the minimap** — live dungeon layout and player positions during a run.
- **Moderate the lobby** — kick, ban, and unban players (host only).

By default the dashboard listens on loopback only (`127.0.0.1`). See the [GitHub README](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements#web-dashboard--mimesisplayerenhancement_webdashboard) for LAN binding and security notes.

## Config

After the first launch:

```
<MIMESIS>/UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg
```

Edit anytime; most changes apply fully after a restart. Each feature has its own TOML section and master toggle.

## Support

This mod is not a quick patch — it merges several community mods into one maintained package and adds a lot of original work on top: Harmony patches across the game, a web dashboard, session statistics, spawn/loot/money scaling, dungeon tweaks, and ongoing compatibility testing with new MIMESIS releases. That takes a lot of dedicated time to build, debug, and keep working.

If you enjoy playing with it and want to say thanks, a small donation is genuinely appreciated (but never required):
