Mimesis Player Enhancement is a mod for Mimesis that consolidates and extends a lot of tweaks into one maintained package. Hosts can raise the player limits, expand mimic voice recording and persistence (across game sessions), allow players to join at any time, scale spawns/loot/money to match their needs, randomize dungeons, tune player and mimic behavior, and track session statistics — all from one config file. Clients do not need the mod; only the host does. It also enables the player to use up to 99 different save games within a new UI.

Additionally, there is also a webinterface listening on http://127.0.0.1:8001 per default after the game has been started. It allows you to manage bigger lobbies (kick, ban, respawn) as well as change settings per savegame or globally.
