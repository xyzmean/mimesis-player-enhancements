# Mimesis Player Enhancement

> **Warning — use at your own risk.** Mods change how the game runs; things can break. Only download MelonLoader from [melonwiki.xyz](https://melonwiki.xyz/). If you do not trust a pre-built DLL, [build from source on GitHub](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements).

> **Alpha — under heavy development.** This plugin is not finished and things may not work as expected. Please report bugs and share feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements/issues).

One plugin for MIMESIS multiplayer: more players, more mimic voices, voice persistence, join-anytime (letting friends join an active lobby - they wait in the tram until the current run ends), statistics, spawn/loot/money scaling, dungeon tweaks, mimic possession tuning, a web dashboard, and more — with a single config file instead of juggling separate mods.

Tested with **MIMESIS 0.3.0** and **MelonLoader 0.7.3**.

## Install

### Mod manager (recommended)

Install through **r2modman**, **Gale**, or another Thunderstore client. The MelonLoader dependency is pulled in automatically.

### Manual

1. Install [MelonLoader 0.7.3+](https://melonwiki.xyz/) on your MIMESIS Steam copy.
2. Extract this package and copy `MimesisPlayerEnhancement.dll` and the `MimesisPlayerEnhancement/` folder into `<MIMESIS>/Mods/`.
3. Start the game once.

Remove older separate mods (MorePlayers, More Voices, MimesisPersistence, JoinAnytime, **MoreMimics**) if you still have them — this mod replaces them.

Inspired by community mods like [MorePlayers from NeoMimicry](https://github.com/NeoMimicry/MorePlayers), [MoreVoices from Risikus](https://thunderstore.io/c/mimesis/p/Risikus/More_Voices/), [MimesisPersistence from JoanR](https://github.com/JoanRLopez/MimesisPersistence), and [MimesisJoinAnytime from Shlygly](https://github.com/Shlygly/MimesisJoinAnytime). Thanks for your ideas and initial work :)

## Web dashboard

While the game is running, the mod serves a **browser dashboard** by default — a companion web UI so you do not have to dig through config files for every tweak. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8001/` (default address and port). Set `EnableWebDashboard = false` in config to disable it.

The dashboard is not only for admin actions. From the same interface you can:

- **Global Settings** (header) — edit default mod config anytime, even before joining a session; saved to `UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg`.
- **Settings** (in-game nav, host only) — per-save-slot overrides stored sparsely under `MimesisData/Slot{N}/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.overrides.cfg`; values that match global are removed automatically.
- **View statistics** — session leaderboard and per-player stats when Statistics is enabled.
- **Use the minimap** — live dungeon layout and player positions during a run.
- **Moderate the lobby** — kick, ban, and unban players (host only).

By default the dashboard listens on loopback only (`127.0.0.1`). See the [GitHub README](https://github.com/Kandru/mimesis-player-enhancements#web-dashboard--mimesisplayerenhancement_webdashboard) for LAN binding and security notes.

## Config

After the first launch:

```
<MIMESIS>/UserData/MimesisPlayerEnhancement.cfg
```

Edit anytime; most changes apply fully after a restart. Each feature has its own TOML section and master toggle.

## Support

This mod is not a quick patch — it merges several community mods into one maintained package and adds a lot of original work on top: Harmony patches across the game, a web dashboard, session statistics, spawn/loot/money scaling, dungeon tweaks, and ongoing compatibility testing with new MIMESIS releases. That takes a lot of dedicated time to build, debug, and keep working.

If you enjoy playing with it and want to say thanks, a small donation is genuinely appreciated (but never required):
